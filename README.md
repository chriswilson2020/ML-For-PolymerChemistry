# ML-For-PolymerChemistry Tutorial 1: Polymer Properties.
This ML Tutorial Material for Polymer Chemistry is based on the 2023 publication "Estimation and Prediction of the Polymersâ€™ Physical Characteristics Using the Machine Learning Models" in Polymers by Malashin *et. al*.  This tutorial is produced by the Systems Chemistry Group at Radboud University in Nijmegen.
