# ML-For-PolymerChemistry Tutorial 1: Polymer Properties.
This ML Tutorial Material for Polymer Chemistry is based on the 2023 publication "Estimation and Prediction of the Polymersâ€™ Physical Characteristics Using the Machine Learning Models" in Polymers by Malashin *et. al*.  This tutorial is produced by the Systems Chemistry Group at Radboud University in Nijmegen. 

Index: 
<br> Chapter 1. [Polymer Properties](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/Polymer%20Properties.ipynb): Jupyter (iPython) notebook that imports the original dataset and pre-processes the data in accordance with the methodology of Malashin *et. al*.
<br> Chapter 2. [Polymer Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/Polymer_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb): Analysis of the original dataset and plots of the data in order to identify the size and quality of the avaliable data. Some methods have been improved based on the original Malashin publication.
<br> Chapter 3. [Polymer ML](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/Polymer_ML.ipynb): The start of the Machine Learning process on the dataset
<br> Chapter 4. [Model Variations](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/Polymer_ML_Model_Variations.ipynb): Exploring different linear regression models from the publication
<br> Chapter 5. [Extending the Models](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/Extending_ML_Models.ipynb): Diverging from the original publication and extending the models into potentially more applicable options.

<br> [The Original Dataset](https://github.com/catauggie/polymersML/blob/main/polyinfo%20homopolymer.xlsx): The original dataset is uploaded [here](https://github.com/chriswilson2020/ML-For-PolymerChemistry/blob/main/polyinfo%20homopolymer.xlsx) for archival purposes
